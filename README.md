# CPAC_CollectiveDynamicPortrait

## Abstract:

The goal of this project is to represent the collectivity of personalities of all the participants at this exposition. It will become a common, interactive portrait of all of them.

The experience starts with a blank screen with no sound being produced. 
The first person will move in front of the empty portrait  and, using his smartphone, will be asked to show his Spotify Code to a camera. After this process also his face will be scanned. 

Consequently, the screen will start showing a portion of the personâ€™s face in the center, processed with a style based on his spotify account. In the meanwhile, also a sound will be produced, with some characteristics also based on Spotify (e.g. timbra).

The following participants will repeat the same process, but after each iteration they will see a more complete and complex painting and musical background, since all the contributions will sum up.

Each participant will also be able to move his hand in front of the painting in order to alter the audio/video result, getting closer or further to the contribution of each person (the background of the painting will work like an abstract plane where all the contributions are distributed).
